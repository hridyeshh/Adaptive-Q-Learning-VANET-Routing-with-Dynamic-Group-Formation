# Network Theory in VANET Simulation

## Introduction to VANET Networks

Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) represent a specialized form of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) where vehicles act as nodes in a dynamic, self-organizing wireless network. This document outlines the key network theory concepts implemented in our Adaptive Q-Learning VANET Routing project.

## Core Network Concepts

### Network Topology in VANETs

VANETs exhibit a highly dynamic topology characterized by:

- **Rapid topology changes**: Due to vehicle mobility, network connections form and break frequently
- **Variable node density**: From sparse (highway) to dense (urban intersections) environments
- **Constrained mobility patterns**: Vehicles follow road infrastructures, creating predictable yet complex movement patterns

Our simulation models these dynamics across three distinct environments:
- Urban (grid-based with high density)
- Highway (linear with variable speed)
- Suburban (mixed with medium density)

### Communication Paradigms

The simulation implements multiple communication paradigms:

1. **V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle)**: Direct communication between vehicles within transmission range
2. **V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure)**: Communication between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs)
3. **V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything)**: Holistic communication encompassing V2V, V2I, and other modalities

## Adaptive Q-Learning Routing Algorithm

### Q-Learning Fundamentals

Our implementation utilizes Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that learns optimal action-selection policies through experience. In the context of VANET routing:

- **States**: Network conditions (density, link quality, congestion level)
- **Actions**: Routing decisions (next hop selection, group formation)
- **Rewards**: Successful packet delivery, reduced latency, network efficiency
- **Q-Value**: Expected utility of taking a specific action in a specific state

The Q-Update rule is defined as:

```
Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[R + γ·max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```

Where:
- α is the learning rate
- γ is the discount factor
- R is the reward
- s and a are the current state and action
- s' and a' are the next state and potential actions

### Adaptive Components

Our Q-Learning implementation adapts to:

1. **Variable traffic density**: Adjusting routing strategies based on node concentration
2. **Link quality fluctuations**: Learning optimal paths considering signal strength and interference
3. **Mobility patterns**: Anticipating topology changes based on road structures and vehicle movement

## Dynamic Group Formation

### Group Formation Algorithm

The simulation employs a distance-based clustering algorithm that forms communication groups by:

1. Calculating Euclidean distance between vehicles
2. Establishing group membership based on proximity thresholds
3. Adapting thresholds according to the environment (urban, highway, suburban)
4. Limiting group size to maintain communication efficiency

### Centrality Metrics

The following centrality metrics are used to identify optimal group leaders and improve network performance:

- **Degree Centrality**: Number of direct connections a node maintains
- **Link Loss Rate**: Inverse measure of connection reliability
- **Geographic Position**: Spatial distribution within the network

## Performance Metrics

Our simulation tracks several key metrics to evaluate network performance:

| Metric | Description | Significance |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Vehicle Density | Number of vehicles per unit area | Affects network congestion and resource allocation |
| Average Link Loss | Percentage of failed transmissions | Measures communication reliability |
| Degree Centrality | Connection count per node | Identifies critical nodes for routing |
| Group Stability | Duration of group configuration | Indicates adaptive algorithm effectiveness |

## Challenges and Solutions

### Scalability Challenges

- **Challenge**: Performance degradation with increasing network size
- **Solution**: Hierarchical routing through dynamic group formation, reducing overall routing complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)

### Mobility Challenges

- **Challenge**: High node mobility causing frequent link failures
- **Solution**: Predictive link quality estimation using Q-learning that anticipates topology changes

### Routing Overhead

- **Challenge**: Control message flooding consuming bandwidth
- **Solution**: Adaptive beaconing rates based on vehicle density and mobility patterns

## Implementation Details

The networking components are implemented using modern web technologies, with:

- Network simulation running in real-time with user-adjustable parameters
- Geographic mapping for real-world location simulation
- Real-time visualization of network topology and metrics
- Dynamic adjustment of network parameters
